# Spotify Comments
A comment platform for spotify songs

# Use it
Run the server on port 8888 `pythom -m http.server 8888` and open it in the webpage
Make sure the server is running. in the consts.js there is a replit, either fork it and change the backend url to the replit or try and run my replit. then authorize your Spotify. When youre listening to a song it will pop up and load all the comments, you can then post comments and see other people's comments. if you fork the repo make sure to set the GitHub up (  cant be that hard ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  )
